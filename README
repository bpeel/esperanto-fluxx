Esperanto Fluxx

To generate the deck run ./fluxx.py. This will generate two sets of
files:

esperantofluxx.pdf
  This will be a document with the cards laid out
  on A4-sized pages suitable for printing.

esperantofluxx-XX.png
  This will be a series of images that are suitable for importing into
  the Tabletop Simulator game.
